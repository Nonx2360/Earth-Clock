        <p>
            Welcome to the World Clocks application! This web application allows users to view the current time in various cities around the world. Whether you're planning a trip, coordinating with friends in different time zones, or simply curious about the time
            in other parts of the globe, this tool makes it easy to check the time.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can search for a city or use a specific time zone format (e.g., GMT+7) to find out the local time. The application provides two types of clocks: digital and analog, allowing you to choose the format that suits you best.
        </p>
        <p>
            This project was created to help people easily access time-related information, enhancing your global awareness and scheduling efficiency.
